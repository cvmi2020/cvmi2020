						Dongfang Liu, PhD recently joined the Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine
						
						and the Center for Immunity and Inflammation as an Associate Professor. In 2012, Dr. Liu was
						
						recruited to Baylor College of Medicine as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of
						
						Pediatrics and Department of Pathology & Immunology, before joining Houston Methodist Hospital (a
						
						teaching hospital affiliated with Weill Cornell Medical College) as an assistant professor in 2015. In
						
						2018, Dr. Liu was promoted to an Associate Professor in Houston Methodist Research Institute. Dr. Liu
						
						did his postdoctoral training on natural killer (NK) cells at the National Institute of Allergy and
						
						Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2005 to 2011. After completing
						
						the postdoctoral training, he joined Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard in 2011 as a senior
						
						research scientist, where he worked on HIV-specific CTL dysfunction with a focus on PD-1 in HIV-
						
						specific CTLs. His current research is primarily focused on the immunobiology of chimeric
						
						antigen receptor (CAR) T and NK cells, immunoreceptors, CAR immunotherapy, and HIV-specific CTLs
						
						in chronic HIV and its related malignancies, with a focus on immunological synapse biology and its
						
						clinical applications. His research is supported by several NIH grants, including an R01 and three
						
						R21 grants.

                <span>Kunal Ghosh, Ph.D., Inscopix. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Kunal Ghosh is founder and CEO of Inscopix, Inc., a Palo Alto-based startup developing a
                    platform for mapping brain circuits. Kunal founded Inscopix out of a research project at
                    Stanford University that resulted in the invention of a miniature, integrated microscope
                    for in vivo brain imaging. The invention is the centerpiece of Inscopix's core brain circuit
                    mapping products which today have already advanced fundamental knowledge of the
                    brain circuits underpinning brain function and behavior. Inscopix's platform also has the
                    potential of shaping the future of neuro-therapeutic discovery, enabling the development
                    of entirely new in vivo circuit-based assays for diseases such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and
                    depression. Kunal is a passionate advocate of the role of business as a force for good in
                    society, and especially the role of entrepreneurial ventures in catalyzing a technologyfueled
                    revolution in
                    brain science and mental health. He is a frequent speaker on these
                    themes at scientific meetings, industry conferences, and top Business schools, and serves
                    on the World Economic Forum's Council on Neurotechnologies and Brain Science. Kunal
                    holds a BSE in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, a BS from the
                    Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and an MS and PhD in Electrical
                    Engineering from Stanford University.

                <span>Sharmishtaa Seshamani, Ph.D., Allen Institute. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span> Dr. Sharmishtaa Seshamani is part of the Cell Types team at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Her current research focuses on building a data processing pipeline to image cells in mouse and human brain, to elucidate the structural complexity of cell morphology and ultrastructural connectivity of neural circuits. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, where she focused on developing meta-registration and mosaicking techniques for endoscopic imaging. Prior to joining the Allen Institute, Dr. Seshamani was a Senior Fellow in the Biomedical Image Computing Group at the University of Washington. There, she developed a pipeline for fetal fMRI analysis which included algorithms for MRI artifact correction, motion estimation and reconstruction.  Currently Dr. Sheshamani develops tools for linear and elastic registration and 3D image reconstruction optimized for large datasets, including electron microscopy (EM) data as part of the MICrONS project: https://microns-explorer.org/. Her interests include applications of machine learning techniques for automatic parameter selection and connectivity data analysis.

                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Winfried Wiegrabe, Ph.D., Allen Institute. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Dr. Wiegrabe is the Director of Microscopy & Image Analysis at the Allen Institute. All his
                    professional life, Winfried has used, programmed, and built microscopes. He worked in
                    industry and academia, in Germany and the US. Winfried received his diploma in
                    Biophysics and Machine Tools and Industrial Management from the Technical University
                    in Munich, Germany. For his diploma and Ph.D. thesis he joined the Department of
                    Molecular Structural Biology headed by Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max-Planck Institute
                    for Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany. Under the mentorship of Reinhard ‘Guckus’
                    Guckenberger, Winfried investigated hydrated bacterial surface proteins with scanning
                    tunneling microscopy (STM). He developed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to
                    measure their conductivity. He complemented this data with measurements of their local
                    elasticity and friction. For a short post-doc, he joined the group of Eberhard Unger at the
                    Institute for Molecular Biology in Jena, Germany. He applied low current STM to hydrated
                    microtubules. Being in Jena, where Carl Zeiss founded his microscopy company and Ernst
                    Abbe worked out the theory of the light microscope and its resolution limit, Winfried
                    headed a R&D team at Carl Zeiss to develop a product based on the discoveries of Eric
                    Betzig, the scanning near field optical microscope (SNOM) to overcome this limit. Later,
                    he became world-wide product manager for fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCS),
                    a method that can measure the concentration, diffusion properties, and molecular
                    interactions of proteins within living cells. In 2001, Winfried joined the Carl Zeiss group
                    in the USA and helped customers to be successful users of confocal and two-photon
                    microscopes (NLO), as well as FCS. In 2005, Winfried moved back to academia and joined
                    the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. He created the
                    group for Advanced Instrumentation and Physics and became later the Head of the
                    Stowers Microscopy Center. In this capacity he supported and built with his team a large
                    variety of microscope techniques, from laser micro-dissection to super-resolution
                    techniques and light sheet microscopy. He developed technology to automatically
                    perform FCS measurements on 4000 different proteins in yeast.
